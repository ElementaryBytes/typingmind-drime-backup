# Security Considerations & Limitations ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Read this entire document before using this software with important data. ## What This Software Does Well ✓ Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption ✓ Zero-knowledge architecture (we can't see your data) ✓ Encryption key never sent to servers ✓ Industry-standard encryption ✓ Strong key derivation (PBKDF2 100,000 iterations) ## Encryption Limitations ⚠️ Not military-grade encryption ⚠️ Browser Web Crypto API has limitations ⚠️ Encryption strength depends on password strength ⚠️ Lost encryption keys = lost data (UNRECOVERABLE) ⚠️ Password strength is critical ## KEY MANAGEMENT - CRITICAL **If you forget your encryption key, your data is PERMANENTLY UNRECOVERABLE** - We cannot recover or reset your key - No backup encryption key exists - No master key to decrypt for you - Only solution: remember your key or lose data ### Password Strength Required Use at least 12 characters: - Mix uppercase and lowercase - Include numbers - Include special characters (!@#$%^&*) - Do NOT use: dictionary words, personal info, dates ### Secure Key Storage - Store in password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass) - Do NOT write on paper - Do NOT store in plain text files - Do NOT share with anyone - Do NOT type in public (visible screen) ## What We Don't Protect Against ⚠️ Local Device Compromise - If someone has physical access, they could capture your key ⚠️ Browser Vulnerabilities - XSS attacks could capture your encryption key - Browser zero-days could expose key in memory ⚠️ Drime Account Compromise - If Drime account is hacked, attacker gets encrypted files - They CANNOT decrypt without your key - Protect your Drime password too! ⚠️ Network Interception - Encrypted files safe, but metadata could be exposed - Always use HTTPS (this software requires it) ⚠️ Operating System Compromise - Malware could capture key before encryption - Keep OS updated and use antivirus ## Specific Limitations ⚠️ No Hardware Security Module - Keys in browser, not in hardware enclave ⚠️ No Deniability - Encrypted files prove you used this software - File sizes could be analyzed ⚠️ PBKDF2 Limitations - Browser CPU-limited - May be insufficient against future attacks ⚠️ localStorage Vulnerability - API token stored in localStorage (encrypted but vulnerable to XSS) ## NOT Suitable For ❌ Medical records (HIPAA) ❌ Financial data (PCI-DSS) ❌ Legal documents with privilege ❌ Highly classified information ❌ Zero-loss-tolerance scenarios ❌ Data requiring professional audit ## Professional Recommendations ✓ DO: - Test backup and restore thoroughly - Use strong encryption key (12+ characters) - Keep encryption key securely stored - Maintain independent backups - Update browser and OS regularly - Monitor Drime account for suspicious activity - Read Drime's privacy policy - Report security issues responsibly ✗ DON'T: - Don't rely solely on this tool - Don't use weak encryption key - Don't share encryption key - Don't store key in plain text - Don't use on public/shared computers - Don't disable browser security - Don't assume perfect security ## Responsible Disclosure If you find a security vulnerability: 1. Do NOT post publicly 2. Email [YOUR_EMAIL] privately 3. Allow 90 days for response/fix ## No Professional Audit This software has NOT been professionally audited. - Code reviewed by developer only - No independent security assessment - No penetration testing - Use at your own risk ## Summary This is free, volunteer software. Use it for: ✓ Personal TypingMind backups ✓ Non-critical data ✓ Data where testing is possible ✓ Supplementary backups (not sole backup) DO NOT use for: ❌ Highly sensitive data ❌ Regulated information ❌ Mission-critical data ❌ Zero-loss scenarios --- **By using this software, you accept these limitations and risks.**
