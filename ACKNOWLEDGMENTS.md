# Acknowledgments & AI Assistance Disclosure ## AI-Assisted Development This project was developed with assistance from Claude AI (Anthropic). ### What AI Assisted With 1. **Code Implementation (60-70% of initial code)** - drime-sync-core.js structure and encryption logic - drime-sync-ui.js modal and UI components - Error handling and retry logic - Documentation and comments 2. **Documentation (80% of initial drafts)** - README.md structure and content - Setup guides and examples - API documentation - Code comments ### What the Developer Did 1. **Architecture & Design** - Overall system design - Security model decisions - API integration strategy - Data flow decisions 2. **Security Implementation** - Encryption key management decisions - Security considerations review - Liability disclaimers (legal) - Compliance decisions 3. **Testing & Verification** - Code review for security - Testing against Drime API - Error case handling - Edge case identification 4. **Decision Making** - Feature prioritization - Tool selection - Legal and ethical decisions - Project governance ## Quality Assurance Process - ✓ All code reviewed for security vulnerabilities - ✓ All encryption logic verified - ✓ API calls tested with real Drime service - ✓ Error handling manually tested - ✓ Documentation checked for accuracy - ✓ Legal disclaimers verified - ✓ No code deployed without verification ## Original Project Credit Inspired by [TypeMind Cloud Backup](https://github.com/itcon-pty-au/typingmind-cloud-backup) by itcon-pty-au. This project adapts architecture patterns from the original S3 implementation to support Drime cloud storage. Special thanks to itcon-pty-au for releasing that work under MIT License. ## Tools Used **Claude AI (by Anthropic)** - Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet - Used for: Code generation, documentation, problem-solving ## Contributing When contributing to this project: - Code has been reviewed for security - Feel free to improve or refactor any code - All contributions welcome - See CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines --- **This transparency shows commitment to honest, responsible development.**
